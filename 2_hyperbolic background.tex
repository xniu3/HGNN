\section{Hyperbolic Geometric Models}
Hyperbolic space commonly refers to manifolds with constant negative curvature and is used for modeling complex networks.
In hyperbolic geometry, there are five common isometric models used to describe hyperbolic spaces~\cite{cannon1997hyperbolic}. 
Among them, the Poincaré model, Hyperboloid (Lorenz) model, and Klein model have recently been used in machine learning for preserving different kinds of hierarchies in graphs~\cite{NickelK17Poincare,PoincareGlove,HNN:GaneaBH18,HGNN_Qi,HAtt}. 

\subsection{Poincaré Ball Model}
The Poincaré ball model is a $n$-dimensional model of hyperbolic geometry with nodes located in the unit ball interior, and the 2-dimensional is the Poincaré disk. 
The distance on this manifold with standard negative constant curvature $K=-1$ is defined as: 
\begin{equation}\label{equ:1}
\begin{aligned}
d_{p}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y})=\operatorname{arccosh}\left(1+2 \frac{\|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}\|^{2}}{\left(1-\|\mathbf{x}\|^{2}\right)\left(1-\|\mathbf{y}\|^{2}\right)}\right), 
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{x}$, $\mathbf{y}$ are the nodes inside the Poincaré Ball. 

\subsection{Hyperboloid Model}
The hyperboloid (Lorentz) model is a model of $n$-dimensional hyperbolic geometry as a manifold in the $(n+1)$-dimensional Minkowski space. 
The hyperboloid model consists of $\mathcal{H}^n= \{ x\in \mathcal{R}^{n+1} \mid  \langle x,x \rangle_{\mathcal{M}} = K, x_{0}>0 \}$, where $\langle x,x \rangle_\mathcal{L}$ is the Lorentzian scalar product, $K$ is the curvature, and the distance $d_{\mathcal{H}}(x,y)$ on the hyperboloid model between two points $x$ and $y$ in hyperbolic space with standard hyperbolic curvature $K=-1$ is: 
\begin{equation}
\label{equ:2}
\begin{aligned}
     d_{\mathcal{H}}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})= \langle \mathbf{x},\mathbf{y} \rangle_{\mathcal{L}} = \mathrm{arccosh}({x_0 y_0} - \sum_{i=1}^{n}{x_i y_i}), 
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where  $\mathbf{x}$, $\mathbf{y}$ are the nodes inside the $(n+1)$-dimensional Minkowski space. 

\subsection{Klein Model}
Klein model is a projective model of hyperbolic geometry in which points are represented by the points in the interior of the unit disk (or ball), and lines are represented by the chords. 
The Klein model is defined on $\mathcal{K}^n$ $= \{\mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{R}^n \mid \|\mathbf{x}\| < 1 \}$ , and it can be transformed between the hyperboloid model and the Klein model: 
\begin{equation}\label{equ:3}
\begin{aligned}
    &\pi_{\mathcal{H} \to \mathcal{K}}(\mathbf{x})=\frac{(x_0,...,x_i)}{x_{0}}, \\
    &\pi_{\mathcal{K} \to \mathcal{H}}(\mathbf{x})=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\| \mathbf{x} \|^2}}.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
