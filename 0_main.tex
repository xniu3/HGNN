\begin{abstract}
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely studied in various graph data mining tasks. 
Most existing GNNs embed graph nodes in Euclidean space and thus are less effective to capture the ubiquitous hierarchical structure in real-world networks. 
Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) extend GNNs to hyperbolic space and obtains more powerful node representation capability of the graph with hierarchical structures. 
In hyperbolic geometry, the graph hierarchical structure can be reflected by the curvatures of the hyperbolic space, and different curvatures can model different hierarchical structures of a graph. 
However, most existing HGNNs set the curvature to a fixed value for simplicity, which may not perform well for graphs with complex and diverse hierarchical structure. 
To solve this problem, we for the first time study the adaptive hyperbocil graph neural network model to adaptively learn the optimal curvature according to the input graph. 
We propose RAHGNN, a multi-agent reinforcement learning based framework for building the adaptive hyperbolic graph neural network. Specifically, RAHGNN contains two agents, ACE-Agent and HGNN-Agent for learning the curvature and node representations, respectively. The two agents are updated by a Nash Q-leaning algorithm collaboratively, seeking for the better hyperbolic space indexed by the curvature. 
Extensive experiments on multiple real-world graph datasets demonstrate a significant and consistent improvement in model quality with competitive performance and good generalization ability.
